#### My name's Kyle, and I am an aspiring backend developer learning about the power of APIs and databases to shape our world. I love Python for its intuitiveness, and Java for teaching me the foundations of effective programming. Currently using Python to build the backend for "MLB on Flask", a simple yet dynamic baseball game web app. Learning the ins and outs of AWS cloud deployment as well.

#### On the lookout for a role in backend development using Python or Java. Current Montessori elementary educator with 10+ years experience leading, mentoring, and guiding children and other educators, and helping people develop optimal habits for deeper learning and success. Open to any and all roles that would give me the opportunity to blend my unique background and skillset with my more recently discovered passion for programming. If you're hiring, let's talk!
